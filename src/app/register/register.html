      ChatGPT said: ðŸ‘Œ Got it â€” here are some aspect ratios you can use for your
      carousel that balance desktop widescreen with mobile readability: 16:9 â†’
      Standard widescreen (great for desktop, sometimes too short on tall
      phones). 4:3 â†’ More balanced, gives extra vertical space for captions on
      mobile. 3:4 â†’ Portrait-friendly, works well if images are taller (but
      looks a bit boxed on desktop). 21:9 â†’ Cinematic wide (super clean desktop,
      but not good for mobile captions).
